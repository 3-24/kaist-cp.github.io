I am an Assistant Professor at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr) and the Principal
Investigator of [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr). I received my
Ph.D. from Seoul National University under the supervision of [Prof. Chung-Kil
Hur](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/gil.hur). I am interested in concurrency and parallelism broadly
construed, from microarchitectures to programming languages to algorithms, since concurrency and
parallelism are at the heart of massive data processing.
