  abstract: "All pointer-based nonblocking concurrent data structures should deal with the problem
             of <em>safe memory reclamation</em>: before reclaiming a memory block, a thread should
             make sure that no other threads are concurrently dereferencing the block.  Various safe
             memory reclamation schemes have been proposed in the literature, but none of them
             satisfy the following desiderata at the same time: the scheme should be <em>(i)
             nonblocking</em>: a non-cooperative thread does not prevent the other threads from
             making progress; <em>(ii) robust</em>: a non-cooperative thread does not prevent the
             other threads from reclaiming an unbounded number of blocks; <em>(iii) fast</em>: it
             does not incur significant time overhead; <em>(iv) compact</em>: it does not incur
             significant space overhead; <em>(v) portable</em>: it is efficiently implementable
             using only widely available features; and <em>(vi) versatile</em>: it is widely
             applicable to many data structures.
             <br />
             We introduce PEBR, which we believe is the first scheme that satisfies all the
             properties above.  The key idea is designing a <em>hybrid</em> of pointer- and
             epoch-based reclamation schemes (PBR and EBR, respectively) that is robust like PBR and
             fast and versatile like EBR, while being nonblocking, compact, and portable like both
             of them.  We experimentally evaluate whether PEBR is fast and robust using data
             structure microbenchmarks, for which PEBR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art
             schemes."
