## Questions and Answers

If you have a question, please ask it in [this issue tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/helpdesk/issues).
You may ask questions on computing in general, laboratory, or anything you want to ask.
We will try to answer your questions as detailed as possible.

### Technical expertise

We have expertise on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and formal verification, compiler, and concurrent programming.

- To study [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), we strongly recommend you to start with ["the
  book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). The entire book is worth reading. Read the book,
  implement some Rust code on your own, and ask any questions you've got to have.

- To study [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/), we strongly recommend you to start with [Software
  Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) Volume 1: Logical Foundations. You can
  clone [this mirror](https://github.com/kaist-cp/software-foundations/tree/master/lf). Don't skip
  (too many) exercises---they are the essence of the book. You can learn how to install Coq and
  setup your IDE [here](coq/README.md).

- To study compiler, we strongly recommend you to take [KAIST CS420: Compiler Design](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420).

- To study concurrent programming, we strongly recommend you to take [KAIST CS431: Concurrent Programming](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs492-concur).


### How to ask questions?

- Please first search the web and the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/helpdesk/issues) and see if your question is already answered.
  If not, ask your question in the issue tracker.
- Please describe your question as detailed and organized as possible.
- Don't ask the solutions to the exercises.
- Don't upload codes as images.
- Format your content using [GitHub's Markdown manual](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- Especially pay attention to properly formatting `code`.
